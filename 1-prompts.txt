The enclosed pamphlet says it can take up to two weeks for your dog to learn how to work it, but that is probably an exaggeration as food is a great motivator.

I tried to teach her with her paw but she learned her own way to do it. It is cute to watch them and is much anticipated when I say ""Work the Machine!""

Fussie Cat gave him diarrhea, which I attributed to switching to a new food, but it lasted for the three weeks I fed it to him, and his fur became duller.  Every time my other two cats got into this food, they vomited, which they generally do not do.  My oldest cat just got a checkup.  He now has renal failure.  His numbers were 100% fine just a few months ago.  I can only attribute it to this food.  I believe he has acute renal failure due to some toxin from Fussie Cat.  Fussie Cat is from Thailand-- there are ZERO regulations for pet food there, and can write whatever they feel like on the can.  My vet, when he saw the food, told me to get my cat off of it, and said other clients of his had had bad reactions to this food.<br /><br />If you value your pet's health, stay far, far away from Fussie Cat.  I have my cat on Merrick now, and he is doing better.  I can only hope I can reverse the damage this food has done."

These fruit snacks are very fresh tasting, wonderfully soft and a true ""chewy"" - not a tough, pull-your-teeth-out texture. I could never give my toddler the usual fruit snacks because of the dyes, texture, and the insane amount of sugar. I love everything about these snacks and our whole family eats them!! She gets excited when she sees a pack of her gummies and I buy them on Amazon by the case!

Spent time with our friends who live there.  They made us the most delicious dinner one evening.  Using these bricks...they rolled a ball of mozzarella in thyme, and then rolled a thin slice of prosciutto around the mozzarella ball/thyme.  Then rolled it up in a brick and baked them for about 15 minutes.  I was obsessed with finding these bricks.  I went to gourmet store after gourmet store here to no avail.

9466,B000UBDKII,A1KRGY0Y3BHCPC,JE,0,0,5,1335052800,Awesome coffee!,"Just read the reviews that said it had a chemical taste - I totally disagree. I think it tastes wonderful! I guess its all a matter of personal preference. I love it so much, I cant go back to the regular unflavored coffee. The only thing that's too bad is that it's artificially flavored. I care not because of the taste, but because artificial flavors are probably not too good for me. But I love the taste anyway! Senseo could easily use natural vanilla flavoring, it is probably more expensive, but they should do it anyway to give their customers a better product. Unfortunately too many companies today use non-natural ingredients in the quest for larger profits, which is a sad commentary. Senseo, you need to start using natural vanilla flavor instead of artificial for the health of your customers.<br /><br />But I still love the taste and cant drink any other coffee! The Senseo coffee in general is so wonderful. I've gone through two machines already. The frothiness of Senseo coffee is so delightful...its like cappacino froth only better. I use Silk Vanilla creamer too which gives it an even better taste (their product DOES have the natural vanilla flavor so maybe that is helping with the taste.) Then I always top off my coffee with cinnamon sprinkles which makes it even more wonderful!<br /><br />All in all, a great coffee and coffee system, just please start using natural flavor Senseo, for the health of your customers! You would probably have even more customers if you did. :)"

IF YOU LOVE CHOCOLATE THESE ARE FOR YOU!!!<br />Now mind you when I saw and thought to buy these I thought of my last endeavor with nabisco and a new product.  Those horribly nasty chocolate covered oreos.  they were a waste of my money and I was pissed that I still had a whole pack left.  smh.<br /><br />But these cookies right here...  smh.  ridiculously delicious.  smh.  Mines were gooey, chewy, and oozing chocolate on my fingers as I ate them.  I just now looked to get another cookie out of this too small 10 ounce package and was pissed that I just ate the last one.  smh.<br /><br />But then maybe it's best that the pack is only 10 ounces.  cause being this good if there were more I'd inhale the whole package of that size just as quickly.<br /><br />Don't get discouraged by the white chips on the package.  The taste of chocolate in these cookies is so delicious and so intense that the white chips, (whatever they are) become nonexistent.<br /><br />I say this.  cause I don't like white chocolate, and it's one of the main reasons I was skeptical about buying these cookies.  buy them, try them for yourself.  Totally delicious.  If Nabisco continues to knock it out the park like this, maybe they'll make a comeback in my household.  cause I had stopped buying cookies from disappointment in what I've received in the recent past."

The one thing about this that is somewhat annoying is that it's a two serving packet which means that it makes 16 ounces for liquid.  I really only want to eat up 8 ounces at a time.  That means I have to guess how much is half and then roll up the bag to save the remaining portion.  Even if I did want to eat the entire packet, I don't have a bowl that is 16 ounces (and all my bowls are perfectly normal sized).  The bottom line here is that there is nothing wrong with the taste of the soup (still, I'm not in love with it).  I just wish there was a better way of packaging.

I didn't want a flowery taste. I had tried Alfalfa. It was indeed mild, but still had that traditional honey taste of flowers. So I tried this Acacia honey, and I was pleasantly surprised. It's very good (in a mild sort of way). There are no floral tones (at least to my uneducated palate). It's simple, sweet, mild, with a slight kick towards the end with a somewhat earthy tone (when licked straight off the spoon). I've decided I prefer this over Wild Raspberry honey in my yogurt. Raspberry adds an enjoyable distinctive bright, clean flavor that isn't too overpowering, while it seems the Acacia sweetens the yogurt without flavoring or overpowering it at all, although I seem to sense a pleasing vanilla note. It lets the flavor of the yogurt come through, and that slight ""kick"" disappeared completely. It's so good. (It makes me think of Christmas for some reason!?!?!?) I think it's my new favorite. I'm finally enjoying my homemade yogurt again! Yea! And it tastes good with peanut butter, too...I never thought I'd say that about any honey. I haven't tried any other brands of Acacia, so I can't say this is the ""best"" Acacia honey out there, but I did enjoy it and will probably be buying more. Breitsammer is a very popular brand in Germany. Honeys that haven't worked for me for sweetening yougurt: Costco's (blech); Mild Buckwheat (better in coffee); MeadowFoam (too distinctive a flavor, but great for meringue cookies); Star Thistle (nice, but too floral in my yogurt); Alfalfa (too floral); Wild Raspberry (good; great with chocolate).  I don't think you'll regret buying this honey, unless you're looking for a very strong, assertive ""honey"" flavor.<br />Many people rhapsodize over Acacia honey. Please don't let my lack of phrases like ""Oh my, this is like a taste of HEAVEN"", stop you from enjoying this honey. I am not a honey-lover, myself. In fact, I don't like it, but am forced to limit my sweeteners to only honey. But I consider this to be very enjoyable, which is A LOT from a former avowed honey-hater. (And now I'm enjoying my yogurt for dessert it tastes so good.)"

Brown the onion and chicken.  Add 3-4 cups of water and the potatoes and carrots.  Cook for 15-20 minutes until the potatoes are done.

47025,B001E5E3B2,A1KSQOZY8AFWUJ,Paul,5,5,5,1184284800,My 1st choice in raisin bran for 60 years,"The wisdom in the old saying, ""compare apples to apples...oranges to oranges,"" etc. applies here. If you compare Skinner's Raisin Bran to other raisin brans, you are comparing apples to oranges, so to speak. Skinner's is made by an entirely different process than any other raisin brans. While I have had to use Post Raisin Bran and some of the organic products when I was unable to find Skinner's, the difference in taste is dramatic. The difference is in the way each is made. Skinner's is made by steaming the whole wheat kernels, rolling them flat and baking them. The common brands of raisin brans are made from wheat flour and other ingredients, and the flour is most commonly ""bleached and enriched"", having been refined by separating the components of the wheat berry and bleaching the endosperm,the major ingredient in bleached wheat flour. Therefore, cereals made with bleached wheat flour lack the bran and most certainly the wheat germ. Those two nutritionally essential components of the wheat berry (the bran and the germ) not only provide the strong flavor, but also all the healthy ingredients provided by ""whole wheat"". Furthermore, it is a well-known fact that only whole grains can be completely metabolized by the body; refined grains less so and tend to be stored rather than fully metabolized.<br /><br />Therefore, for those cereal eaters who are accustomed to raisin bran or other cereals made from wheat flour with flavor enhancers, the Skinner's at first taste may seem strong, mainly because whole wheat has a strong flavor, which could be interpreted as ""bad"" because it is so different from those made with refined flour. Also, because they are made from the whole wheat berry, the Skinner's flakes have a much firmer texture, the advantage of which is that they do not get soggy in milk before you eat the whole serving. My children and grandchildren all prefer Skinner's, either as a breakfast cereal or as muffins or cookies. I am so thankful to be able to get this product from Amazon since it is scarce in the markets in my region. Remember, apples to apples, oranges to oranges...."
