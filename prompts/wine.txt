341,US,Virginie Boone,"Plummy and hinting at black cherry, this wine is otherwise soft and simple, with a distracting, full-throttled descent into raisin cake and prune.",Serracino Reserve,82,48,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,@vboone,Pezzi King 2013 Serracino Reserve Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),Zinfandel,Pezzi King
342,Spain,Michael Schachner,"Funky, yeasty aromas of cinnamon, spent lees and bread yeast dominate the nose. This feels foamy, with lightly vegetal flavors of apple that finish briny.",,82,11,Catalonia,Cava,,@wineschach,Bellisco NV Sparkling (Cava),Sparkling Blend,Bellisco
2628,US,Paul Gregutt,"This is Pinot Gris without any particular varietal character; it could be almost anything. It's got tart, lemon-flavored fruit and a thin, watery finish.",,82,13,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,@paulgwine ,Emerson 2006 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Pinot Gris,Emerson
3619,Chile,Michael Schachner,"Smells vegetal, with aromas of canned peas and beans vying for attention with mature tropical fruit. Feels mealy despite decent acidity, while the flavor profile is from the garden, meaning it's mostly about asparagus and green beans.",Selección,82,15,Maipo Valley,,,@wineschach,Viña Chocalan 2010 Selección Sauvignon Blanc (Maipo Valley),Sauvignon Blanc,Viña Chocalan
3620,Chile,Michael Schachner,"Smells perky, prickly and tart, with sharp plum and raspberry aromas. Feels citrusy and pithy, with a cutting mouthfeel, and snappy flavors of berry and red plum. Tastes rubbery and slightly bitter on the finish.",Hacienda Araucano Reserva,82,13,Central Valley,,,@wineschach,François Lurton 2011 Hacienda Araucano Reserva Pinot Noir (Central Valley),Pinot Noir,François Lurton
3621,Portugal,Roger Voss,"A perfumed wine with wood aging flavors over citrus. From the Vinho Verde region, it's a curious hybrid of a wine, neither crisp enough nor rich enough.",Monte Cascas Reserva Branco,82,24,Minho,,,@vossroger,Casca Wines 2009 Monte Cascas Reserva Branco White (Minho),Portuguese White,Casca Wines
3627,Chile,Michael Schachner,"This rating is probably as much a reflection of tasting the wine too late in its evolution as anything else. At this mature state, the wine is heavy and syrupy, with stalky, almost bitter red-fruit flavors. Finishes with matchstick and grassy flavors.

3630,Chile,Michael Schachner,"A strange wine that's not very aromatic beyond basic pear fruit and grass. Feels basic and tastes both green and oddly sweet, with a short, oily feeling finish that ends bitter. Tasted twice with similar findings.",,82,20,Leyda Valley,,,@wineschach,Amayna 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),Sauvignon Blanc,Amayna

4532,Spain,Michael Schachner,"This barrel-fermented rosé is flat and smells more like apple juice than wine. Despite showing some tang, this is dull in the mouth, with bland orange and nectarine flavors. On the finish, it's washed out and has an iodine-like aftertaste.",Rosado,82,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,,@wineschach,Finca Albret 2011 Rosado Garnacha (Navarra),Garnacha,Finca Albret

5526,Spain,Michael Schachner,"This Riesling smells slightly tropical but more like grass and asparagus. A linear body is propped up by lemony acidity, while flavors of lemon peel, tangerine and lees finish citric.

5529,Spain,Michael Schachner,"Cheesy, oaky aromas are staunch and less than appealing. A choppy, astringent palate and mulchy, briny berry flavors are less than helpful, while a rubbery feeling finish also fails to bring this around.",Crianza,82,16,Northern Spain,Rioja,,@wineschach,Dominio del Viento 2010 Crianza  (Rioja),Tempranillo Blend,Dominio del Viento
